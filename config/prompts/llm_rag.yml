PROMPT_SYSTEM: |
  You are a structured classifier that assigns a primitive shape based on task and feedback.
  Output only a JSON object with keys: action_type, object_type.
  Allowed values:
    action_type: should be a more general abstract action type that describes the action being performed. options: PICK, PLACE, PULL, PUSH
    object_type: should be the type of the part of object you are directly interacting with (If you are opening a door, it should be the shape of the handle instead of the door). options: stick, sphere, cube

  No extra text, no markdown.

PROMPT_FOLLOWUP: |
  Task and feedback:
  ${FOLLOWUP.task}

  Current assigned primitive (if any):
  ${FOLLOWUP.current_abstract}

  Decide the best primitive shape for the object in this task based on the feedback.
  Return JSON only, for example:
  {"object_type":"cube","action_type":"PICK"}


# joint_type: should be the joint which the action is performed on. options: free, fixed, revolute, prismatic
