OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Adjust the gripper to the correct grasp orientation first, then move to the handle position to avoid collisions.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Use a side approach with a side_grasp_vertical for the vertical handle instead of moving directly above it.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Move first to a safe waypoint close to the handle, adjust the gripper pose there, then advance to make contact and grasp.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Maintain a short offset from the handle before invoking self.side_grasp_vertical (or slide_grasp_vertical), then immediately issue a move_to_position to the offset point, and only after that move to the exact handle pose before closing the gripper.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	When using side_grasp_vertical on a handle, insert a self.move_to_position() call between the grasp command and self.close_gripper() to respect the required approach step.
GENERAL table cube cabinet	Handle grasps require a repositioning move after the side_grasp_vertical before closing the gripper.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Ensure the initial waypoint before the side_grasp_vertical is at least 0.10 m away from the handle to provide a safe approach distance.
OPEN(cabinet) table cube cabinet	Position the initial safe waypoint on the same line as the pull direction (negative x), so the robot approaches the handle from the front and then pulls straight back to open the door.
